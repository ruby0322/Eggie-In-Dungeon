"# Eggie-In-Dungeon" 

This is my VERY FIRST Python project.

I started the project after only 2 days of learning Python.

So, there must be a lot of bad namings and many other bad habits in my code.

I also don't know how to seperate my classes into different files, but now I do, so please don't be to harsh on me back then.
